# Numerical Analysis

This Module is Numerical analysis, area of mathematics and computer science that creates, analyzes, and implements algorithms for obtaining numerical solutions to problems involving continuous variables. Such problems arise throughout the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and business.

## How to Install

Pip install this module from your console<br/>
`pip install _________`<br/>
Import this to module your Work Space<br/>
`import Num_Analysis`<br/>
And you are good to go

## Explore (How It Works)

This at present contain 3 parts

This part contain interpolation Method at present having only one method but in near future you can also explore new ones
